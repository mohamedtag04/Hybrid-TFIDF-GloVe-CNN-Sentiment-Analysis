# Hybrid Sentiment Analysis with BERT and CNN

A sentiment analysis project using a hybrid model combining BERT and CNN, employing GloVe embeddings and TF-IDF for enhanced text representation.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `models/`: Houses trained models.
- `notebooks/`: Provides Jupyter notebooks for demonstrations.
- `src/`: Includes source scripts for processing, modeling, and training.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for validating functionality.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Load and preprocess datasets.
4. Train the model with hybrid features.

## Usage
- Train the model using `src/train.py`.
- Test data processing and model integrity with unit tests in `tests/`.

## Requirements
Check `requirements.txt` for necessary Python libraries.
